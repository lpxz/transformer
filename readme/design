1 I add the debugging information for the replay!
2 use the leap.transformer.arg and leap.recorder.arg to seamlessly pass the parameters.
The advantage is that, you can use leap.transformer.arg and the classes
with or without hte preprocessing applied.
3 replayerdriver uses the reflection now as some main classes can not be invoked directly.
4 package-level filter -> class-level filter
5 synchronized method- > synchronized block!
6 double guard to filter the unrelated classes.
One is the excludeInclude string filter in the soot argument, the other is the shouldInstrument method.
7 support the JDK library classes such as  hashmap/vector.
