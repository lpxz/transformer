RecordMain first initializes the necessary data structures in the RecordMonitor, even before invoking the application main method.
1 accessvectors 2 threadNameToIdMap

Then, in the invocation of main or run, we update the threadNameToIdMap
In the accesses of shared data, we update the accessvectors


update the threadNameToIdMap:
	public static void threadStartRun(long threadId)
	{
		threadNameToIdMap.put(Thread.currentThread().getName(),threadId);
	}
	put the main/run method-tid mapping into a map.
update the accessvectors:
    accessSPE(index,tid);	
    
    //=================
    the original implementation is problematic, as it purposely remove the correct locks.
    Some application which worked previously do not work after the removal!
    
    	//should be synchronized                                       
	public  void parse(String key)                                            
	{           
		synchronized (this) //if I commet this line, it crashes, otherwise, it wont.

    	String val = getVal(key);
    	if(val.equals("Alice"))
    		replaceVal(key,"A");
    	if(val.equals("Bob"))
    		replaceVal(key,"B");
		}
	}
