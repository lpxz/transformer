clear the intermediateCP and tmp/ first
Take avrora for example:
1 run it with the jvm argument: -javaagent:/home/lpxz/eclipse/workspace/soot24/lib/poa.jar=out/avrora-small
2 fill the leap.transformer.arg with the classpath and also the main class
the classpath should be the absolute path, e.g., "c /home/lpxz/eclipse/workspace/avrora/out/avrora-small AvroraMainHarness"
Note that, some classes may be missed and soot can not pass, just make soot24 references the original project, and "-pp" option will 
help solving the class-loading problem.
3 Run DacapoTransformPreprocess, it is similar to TransformPreprocess, but with "-p cg reflection-log:*.log"
the output is placed in the intermediateCP (the referenced classes should all be there) as usual.
4 Run TransformMain, it parses the classes in the intermediateCP folder, and generates the final output in the "tmp/record".

5 When recording, you may need to copy certain data to the current usr.dir of the recorder project. 
Note that, "." corresponds to the project/ instead of project/bin/
