1 why do we need to distinguish the object?
consider the array or hashmap,
if you think all the arraries are the same, then there would be high contention of the accesses of the indices.
Actually, the accesses map to different arraries and hence do not need synchronization!
The original implementation ignores the array!!!

2 change the synchronized method to syncrhonized blocks!
Otherwise, no way to control the monitor. (sm is a runtime mechanism of JVM)
